# SQL-Table-Relationships
I am working with a strongly strucutred RDBMS with Primary and Foreign keys clearly defined. <br>
I recently wanted to pull the relationships between tables.  I couldn't find anything already published on this and a few people said it was impossible. <br>
Although the relationships aren't in the schema, it's possible to pull from the data. <br>
I adapted the query for the foreign keys in the database published by Dataedo, https://dataedo.com/kb/query/sql-server/list-foreign-keys-sql-queries. <br>
I used Adventureworks2022, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms. <br>
NOTE: this query assumes the existince of primary and foreign keys in the database.
